<h2>Problem Statement: Block chain for improved water resource management. (Decentralised water reuse system Blockchain for improved water resource management.)</h2>
<p>
By 2050 nearly 70 % of the world‚Äôs population will reside in cities. More than 90 % of this urban growth is projected to occur in emerging markets where large-scale, centralized infrastructure may not be feasible or advisable. whether due to financial constraints governance challenges and climate variability. Decentralized solutions can play a critical role in these settings to complement traditional approaches and expand access to safe water and sanitation services. Blockchain for improved water resource management. By providing a secure transparent and distributed ledger to record transactions between parties, blockchain-based technology fundamentally could transform the way water resources are managed and traded. First and foremost, harnessing this capability could enable everyone from households, industry consumers, water managers, and policymakers to access the same data on water quality and quantity and make more informed decisions. Such transparency would help inform consumer decisions around went to conserve or use water. In terms, it could help prevent corrupt behavior in situations where there may ban e incentive for local authorities to temper with or withhold water quality data.

Blockchain technology also could support peer-to-peer trading of water rides in a given basin, empowering water users who have enough or are willing to share their excess resources with others in the area to do so 24/7 without relying on a centralized authority/system. Imagine a scenario where farmers in the same water basin could decide to trade their allocation based on the latest weather data, crop rises, market trends, and long-term climate trends.

<h2>How we built it üßë‚Äçüíª</h2>

<p>We are proud to present AquaSavvy, built with a blend of cutting-edge technologies to create a powerful and seamless user experience.</p>

<h3>Frontend</h3>

<p>For the frontend, we utilized the popular Create React App (CRA) framework, enhanced further with React App Rewired to fine-tune CRA and significantly reduce build times. React served as the foundation for our user interface, enabling smooth interactions and dynamic content presentation.</p>

<h3>Backend</h3>

<p>In the backend, we leveraged Hardhat, a robust web3 Ethereum development framework. This provided us with the tools and flexibility required to build a secure and efficient backend for AquaSavvy. To connect with the Sepolia testnet, we integrated Alchemy rpc, ensuring reliable and real-time interactions with the Ethereum network.</p>

<h3>Smart Contract Integration</h3>

<p>To link the frontend and backend seamlessly, we employed ethers.js, a powerful library for Ethereum interactions. This allowed us to integrate smart contracts seamlessly into our application, enabling secure water reserve trading and management.</p>

<h3>Image Storage on IPFS</h3>

<p>To ensure persistent and decentralized image storage, we integrated Pinata with our application. By storing images on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), we guarantee that users can retrieve these images even if their addresses on the internet change.</p>

<h3>Map Integration</h3>

<p>To provide a visual representation of water reserves, we integrated the React Leaflet library, offering an interactive map with markers at the locations of water reserves. This empowers users to easily locate and explore available water resources.</p>

<h3>Auto Suggestions (Currently Disabled)</h3>

<p>We implemented auto suggestions using the Google Maps API to enhance user convenience. However, due to the expiry of our Google Cloud credits, this feature is temporarily disabled. We plan to reinstate it in the future to enrich user experience further.</p>

<p>AquaSavvy stands as a testament to the potential of innovation when powered by advanced technologies and creative problem-solving. Our team's dedication and collaboration have made this project a reality, and we are excited to share it with the world.</p>

<p>Building AquaSavvy presented us with various hurdles, each of which we tackled with determination and teamwork.</p>

<h3>Novelty in DApp Development</h3>

<p>None of us had prior experience with building a DApp, making the journey an exciting but challenging endeavor. While some team members were familiar with the development process, this was our first attempt at creating a decentralized application.</p>

<h3>Custom Smart Contract Creation</h3>

<p>Given the uniqueness of our DApp, we needed a custom smart contract tailored to our specific requirements. Designing and developing this smart contract posed its own set of challenges, but it also allowed us to create a solution perfectly aligned with our vision.</p>

<h3>Integration with Metamask</h3>

<p>Integrating the frontend with Metamask, a critical component for interacting with the Ethereum network, proved to be a formidable task. Numerous bugs emerged during the process, requiring thorough debugging and testing to ensure seamless connectivity.</p>

<h3>Contract Deployment Struggles</h3>

<p>Deploying the smart contract had its share of obstacles. The available faucets for testing had limitations, and we frequently encountered exhaustion of test Ether while deploying and testing the contract. This necessitated creative problem-solving and meticulous management of resources.</p>

<h3>Google Cloud API Key Retrieval</h3>

<p>Enabling location suggestions on our map required an API key from Google Cloud. However, obtaining this key presented a challenge, as none of us had billing set up with Google Cloud, which typically requires a credit card.</p>

<p>Despite these challenges, our team remained resilient and persevered through adversity. AquaSavvy stands as a testament to our commitment to innovation and a testament to the power of teamwork.</p>
